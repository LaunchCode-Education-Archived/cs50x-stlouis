# Fixing the Debugger

You may have discovered that the built-in Debugger on the CS50 IDE is a little, well, buggy.

LaunchCode mentor Ricky has put together a great guide to how to fix the issues so you can go back to debugging your code. 

The guide is available on his github profile, <a href="https://github.com/dummey/CS50x-Debugger-Help" target="_blank">here</a>.

If you haven't been using the Debugger because it wans't working properly, we **highly** reccomend you give it another chance! With this guide, you should be able to fix it within 3 minutes, and then you will have an indispensible coding (and learning) tool at your disposal.
