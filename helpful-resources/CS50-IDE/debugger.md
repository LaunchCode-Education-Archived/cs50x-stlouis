# Fixing the Debugger

Please take a moment here to read a few things about the CS50 IDE Debugger. We will talk about:

1. How to fix it 
2. The fact that it is awesome
3. How to pass in command-line arguments on the Debugger.

### 1. Fix it

You may have discovered that the built-in Debugger on the CS50 IDE is a little, well, buggy.

LaunchCode mentor Ricky has put together a <a href="https://github.com/dummey/CS50x-Debugger-Help" target="_blank">great guide</a> to how to fix the issues so you can go back to debugging your code. 

### 2. It's Awesome

We can't overemphasize how awesome the Debugger is. If you haven't been using it thus far, we highly reccomend you give it another chance. 
* If you were having trouble running it, Ricky's guide above should take 2 minutes to fix the problem. 
* If you are still confused about what the Debugger does and how to use it, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-G_klBQLgdc" target="_blank">this video</a> again.

We know you have a lot of work on your plate, so the thought of spending additional time to learn yet another thing is daunting. We promise it is worth the small extra time investment to learn how to use this thing. Just an extra few minutes, and then you will have at your disposal a tool which makes it 1000 times easier to understand what your code is doing.

### 3. Command-line arguments

It is not immediately obvious how to use the Debugger for programs that accept command-line arguments. Where do you pass in the arguments?
