# Web Track

### Synopsis

This skill track is a deep-dive into the world of front-end web development!

Over the course of the track, we will build a class project together. Each day for studio, you will add a little bit more onto the project. By the end of the track, you will have built, from scratch, the front end of a website that allows users to keep a running "movie watchlist", so they don't forget all the movies they want to watch. Click here for demo of the finished product: <a href="http://education.launchcode.org/flicklist" target="_blank"/>FlickList</a>.

Over the course of building this project, you will solidify your comfort with the concepts that were introduced in the Web unit of CS50. Along they way, you will also learn and make heavy use of Git, a "version control system" that every serious developer should use!
