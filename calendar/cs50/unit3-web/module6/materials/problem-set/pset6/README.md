# Problem Set 6

### Synopsis
In this problem set, you will write a server in c! Your program will listen for HTTP requests coming in, and then determine and dispatch the appropriate HTTP response. You will be given a lot of starter code with some TODOs left for you.

### How to submit 
On Vocareum you will see one assignment:
  * **Problem Set 6: Server**: For this assignment, submit one file called server.c
  
After signing in, you will see each component as an assignment on the left. You must submit each component separately. Follow the instructions there, and make sure you name your files correctly! Remember, you can ignore the instructions on the Harvard spec on how to submit; we only care about your submission on Vocareum.

### Guidance

A big part of what you'll need to do here is manipulate strings. You will receive the HTTP request coming in as a big string, and your program will have to parse that string to figure out what the request is asking for. Then, you will also be responding with a big string as well; you'll have to build up the response string out of all the appropriate header data and the body content. 

At a few points, the Pset Spec will point you to a handful of useful string manipulation functions from the `<string.h>` library. Do make sure you go and familiarize yourself with these functions when they are mentioned. They will be very helpful!
