##### Trees and Tries
Task | Resource Type | Link | Instructions
-----|------|------|------
Read | Lecture Notes | <a href="http://cdn.cs50.net/2015/fall/lectures/5/w/notes5w/notes5w.html#more_data_structures" target="_blank">Week 5, Continued / More Data Strutures</a> | These notes introduce the idea of a tree data structure, which is like a linked list except that each node can point to more than one "next" node, creating a "branching" effect.
Watch | Short | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFptHjTT3l8&list=PLhQjrBD2T3825srGzBvJGMWJX4PATLYaq&index=3" target="_blank">Trees</a> | Here we learn a little more about trees, including binary search trees.
Read | Lecture Notes | <a href="http://cdn.cs50.net/2015/fall/lectures/5/w/notes5w/notes5w.html#tries" target="_blank">Week 5, continued / Tries</a> | These notes present the trie, a tree structure that provides an alternative to hash tables for storing large amounts of data while keeping lookup times very fast. 
Watch | Doug's Playlist | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRg9DQFu0kU&list=PLhQjrBD2T383tuTZvvexny73B9-sl2aEj&index=5" target="_blank">Tries</a> | Doug talks about tries, the "holy grail" data structure in which all operations can be done in linear time.
Watch | Short | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKr6gWcXkIM&list=PLhQjrBD2T3825srGzBvJGMWJX4PATLYaq&index=4" target="_blank">Tries</a> | Here we walk through a high-level example of using a trie to implement a dictionary of words.
Watch | Short | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4MSwiqfLaY", target="_blank">Recursion</a> | Zamyla talks about recursion in general, and gives some common examples of how recursion can be useful when working with tree-like data structures such as tries.

Read | Lecture Notes | <a href="http://cdn.cs50.net/2015/fall/lectures/5/m/notes5m/notes5m.html#stacks_queues" target="_blank">Week 5 / Stacks & Queues</a> | These notes briefly introduce the concept of two more data structures, the stack and the queue

First, using an array, and second, using `malloc`, which allows you to resize dynamically if you run out of capacity.
